# German Atlantis 6.2

This is the old source code of German Atlantis 6.2 by Alex Schroeder
which was based on the
original
[Atlantis 1.0](ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/games/play-by-mail/old/atlantis/) game.

Atlantis is a *Play By E-Mail* (PBEM) game. Thus, the software reads
emails (concatenated plain text mails) from a file and produces a
script that will send emails out to players.
